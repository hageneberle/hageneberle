    <p class="random-color-font">"Oh, what cynicism!" squeaked Xaver's jade-green frying pan. 
    <br>"I once heard Xaver complain that there was no trust anymore and that no one could be relied upon.

    <br>I can feel my blood boiling as I search everywhere for a trace of my beloved frying pan. 
    <br>Was it stolen? Did someone take it for themselves? 
    <br>The thought of someone else enjoying its non-stick surface and perfect heat distribution makes me blush.</p>
