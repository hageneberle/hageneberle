"Oh, what cynicism!" squeaked Xaver's jade-green frying pan. 
<br>"I once heard Xaver complain that there was no trust anymore and that no one could be relied upon. 
<br>And yet, every day I see Xaver give me his trust to cook his meals. 
<br>Hypocritical, don't you think?". The frying pan continued to gurgle away.
<br>
<br>POV: You are Xaver and you are furious that your frying pan has vanished.
<br>
<br>I can feel my blood boiling as I search everywhere for a trace of my beloved frying pan. 
<br>Was it stolen? Did someone take it for themselves? 
<br>The thought of someone else enjoying its non-stick surface and perfect heat distribution makes me blush.
